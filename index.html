                    My name is Zarah Parker. I currently work as a Tier 2 Technical Suppport Specialist with CivicPlus, in their CivicRec product suite. We are an industry leader in Parks and Recreation management software.
                    As much as I love to find and fix bugs, I'm ready to start making them myself- so I enlisted in the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp! I am excited and scared to embark on this journey, but I am sure that I will be better for it!
                   <br> In my free time, I enjoy hiking, long walks on the beach... Just kidding, I usually chill at home with my dog Hades and my two cats, Galatea and Hercules. They're pretty cool.
                    All of my coding experience thus far is from MySpace. I toyed with basic HTML layouts, using image source and adding line breaks.
                    I'm hoping the incredibly basic knowledge of HTML and CSS that I display here blows you away!
